**Tested with Alfred 3**

This workflow allows you to do inline Google searches right from the Alfred bar.
It gives you the flexibility to either open the result URL or copy it to clipboard.


## Installing

Download [Google Search workflow file](https://github.com/aviaryan/alfred-google-search/raw/master/GoogleSearch.alfredworkflow) 
and double click to open it with Alfred.


## Using

```sh
# search, ENTER to open result in browser
gs search query
# search, ENTER to copy URL to clipboard
gs search query$
```

Ending the search query with a '$' changes the workflow behavior to copy URL instead of opening the URL.

## Inspiration

[Vinta's workflow](https://github.com/vinta/alfred-google-inline-workflow). 
It doesn't work right now and probably it never will, 
and this gave me the motivation to create this workflow with a different approach.
I hope this workflow will continue working for some time to come.
